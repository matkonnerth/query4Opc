opc ua meta meta model (model, which must be used by the information model)

nodes with attributes
8 types of a nodes
ObjectNode
ObjectTypeNode
ReferenceTypeNode
...

References between nodes are type with the main distinction between hierachical and nonhierachical references

opc ua meta model (information model)

Questions:

Should the GraphQL queries work direct on the information model or on the meta meta model?

I think that working directly on the information model let's the client write more concrete queries.

"Give me all objects with a certain type inclusive subtypes from this subtree".

vs.

"Give me all object nodes with reference HasTypeDefinition to one of this ObjectTypeNodes, the object nodes should have hierachical references below this node"

2nd query sounds more or less like the implementation.
